"""
Switching Circuit V2 - Pi-side CSV Recorder.

Records sensor and circuit state data directly on the Pi filesystem
for medium-duration captures with better timing than Mac-side logging.

CSV writes happen on a dedicated daemon thread so the broadcast loop
(which drives circuit timing) is never blocked by file I/O. The queue
is unbounded; at 15 Hz × ~100 B per row, even minutes of disk stall
stay within a few MB of memory. If the queue depth ever exceeds
DEPTH_WARN_THRESHOLD we log one warning so backpressure is visible.
